# Crop-Analysis

This notebook builds a recommendation model for crop selection based on environmental factors. It's part of a larger exercise that I undertook to establish the connection between climate change and hunger in India.

This project leverages data that contains within each record, environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, and a selected crop for those conditions. It's assumed that the crop choice was ideal under the circumstances. Based on that, it builds a recommendation model for crop selection based on environmental factors.

The hypothesis for the larger initiative is that raising temperatures and reducing rainfall will push adoption of a select few crops. Their input profile, such as fertilizer needs (potash for Potassium, urea for Nitrogen), and pesticides needs, will affect their viability as well as nutrition available to the masses.
